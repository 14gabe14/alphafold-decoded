    "In this Notebook, we will implement the feature extraction pipeline for AlphaFold. The pipeline consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parse the a3m file\n",
    "- Count and remove deletions (residues that are present in the aligned sequences, but aren't present in the query sequence)\n",
    "- Randomly select cluster centers\n",
    "- Randomly change some residues from the cluster center (this is called masking)\n",
    "- Assign non-cluster sequences to their closest cluster center\n",
    "- Summarize the features of all sequences assigned to the cluster\n",
    "- Crop non-cluster sequences to a fixed number\n",
    "- Assemble the features\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the work is done to create the `msa_feat` and the `extra_msa_feat`. The input features additionally consist of the `target_feat` and the `residue_index`, but these are easy to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an overview of the features, you can read Section 1.2.9 from [AlphaFold's Supplement](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-021-03819-2/MediaObjects/41586_2021_3819_MOESM1_ESM.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will skip over the template features in this series, but predictions often work great without them (ColabFold has the option to use templates disabled by default)."
