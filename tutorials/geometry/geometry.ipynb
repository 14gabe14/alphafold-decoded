A rotation matrix is just any 3x3 matrix, where the three columns are orthogonal and unit vectors (orthonormal) and oriented in a right-handed fashion. The simplest rotation matrix is just the identity matrix, with 1 on the diagonal and 0s everywhere else. Try coming up with a set of three such vectors and combine them in a matrix, then multiply it against the vertices to rotate the bunny."
